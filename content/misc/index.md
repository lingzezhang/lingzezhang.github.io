My name in Chinese is 张凌泽. "张" is the family name and "凌泽" is the given name. I'm from [Xiangyang](https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/destination/xiangyang-414/), China, which is one of the best places to live in the world if you don't need a job elsewhere.

In 2024 at Brown University, I performed as ***the Coppersmith*** in the drama ***Mr. Donkey***(《驴得水》). You may watch the whole play [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wQySRdis2qU5zUvQ9yBYccOAf29lRjjT?usp=sharing) (Unfortunately, it's in Chinese and there's no English subtitle.).
