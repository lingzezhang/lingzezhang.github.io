    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Lingze, a researcher with a passion for natural language processing and human‚ÄìAI interaction. I am especially fascinated by large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems, focusing on unraveling their inner mechanisms and understanding their capabilities. Equally, I am driven to investigate how human creativity and decision-making processes can be enhanced through collaboration with AI. 

I recently earned my ScM in Computer Science from Brown University, where I had the privilege of working with Ellie Pavlick. Prior to Brown, I gained industry experience in various roles, including machine learning engineer and product manager. I also hold a Master‚Äôs degree in economics, a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in finance, and a Double Bachelor‚Äôs degree in mathematics from Peking University, along with some study experience at the University of Maryland in Human-Computer Interaction.

<span style="color:red">**I am currently seeking research assistant or visiting researcher opportunities to begin as soon as possible, as well as PhD opportunities starting in Fall 2025 or later.**</span>
